## 2026-02-16 - O(N) array search inside object traversal is a major bottleneck
**Learning:** Checking for substrings across an array of terms (`SENSITIVE_FIELD_NAMES.some(term => key.includes(term))`) is extremely slow, especially when executed inside a deep recursive sanitization loop that checks every single object key.
**Action:** Use a pre-compiled Regular Expression (`new RegExp(terms.join('|'), 'i')`) instead. This provides an O(1) lookup in V8 and significantly reduces recursive overhead. Path alias (`@/`) imports in vitest/bun test can be tricky without proper config, but do not override them just to test a unit file locally as they break repo standards.
## 2026-05-15 - Replaced O(N²) loop with O(N) lookup in DashboardOverview.tsx\n**Learning:** The useMemo hook mapping defaultApps and searching inside integrationsQuery.data was an O(N*M) bottleneck.\n**Action:** Use a JavaScript Map (integrationsMap) for O(1) lookups inside the iteration, effectively reducing complexity to O(N+M).
## YYYY-MM-DD - WorkflowBuilder Canvas Drag Optimization
**Learning:** High-polling mice (e.g. 1000Hz) trigger `onMouseMove` excessively in React, which can flood the render queue and cause visual lag during SVG node drags. Standard debouncing/throttling might skip important final coordinate updates or stutter.
**Action:** Always use `requestAnimationFrame` for high-frequency interactive canvas/SVG state updates (e.g. node dragging), tracking the `latestPosRef` and clearing the frame loop when interaction ceases, to perfectly sync with the browser refresh rate (~60 FPS).
## 2026-05-24 - Replaced O(N log N) sort with O(N) reduce for finding max string date
**Learning:** Sorting an array of date strings using `.sort().reverse()[0]` just to find the latest date introduces unnecessary O(N log N) overhead. While N might be small in certain cases, it's an inefficient pattern for finding a simple maximum.
**Action:** Use `.reduce((max, current) => (current !== null && (!max || current > max)) ? current : max, null)` for an O(N) iteration that correctly finds the maximum string value without array mutation or sorting overhead.
## 2026-06-02 - O(N) Array Search Inside Object Traversal
**Learning:** Checking for substrings across an array of terms inside object traversal is slow.
**Action:** Replaced `.some()` array iteration with a precompiled RegExp `SENSITIVE_KEYS_REGEX.test(k)` for O(1) lookups.
## 2026-06-03 - Consolidated O(N) array passes in DashboardOverview.tsx
**Learning:** Sequential `.map().map()` operations in React components cause unnecessary memory allocations and redundant iterations.
**Action:** Always aim to combine sequential array transformations into a single pass when creating derived state, especially when mapping over data that merges with other O(1) structures like Maps.
## 2026-06-05 - Replaced O(N*M) array checks with O(1) Set lookups
**Learning:** Performing `keywords.includes(...)` or `.some(w => ...includes(w))` inside a loop (like scoring agent skills or evaluating JWT roles) creates an O(N*M) bottleneck that degrades performance at scale.
**Action:** Use `Set<string>` (e.g. `new Set(keywords)` or pre-defined constants) and `Set.has()` for O(1) lookups instead. This fundamentally converts O(N*M) operations to O(N+M) or O(N), significantly improving throughput.
## 2026-06-08 - Replaced Object.entries() inside high-frequency scoring loops with pre-calculated arrays
**Learning:** Calling `Object.entries(STATIC_DICT)` inside functions that are called frequently allocates a new array and causes garbage collection overhead on every single invocation.
**Action:** When iterating over static dictionaries, always pre-calculate `const PRE_CALCULATED_ENTRIES = Object.entries(STATIC_DICT)` outside the function scope to achieve zero-allocation array iterations.
## 2026-05-23 - Memoizing List Items in Live Feeds
**Learning:** Extracting list items into a `React.memo`ized component is especially critical for live feeds (e.g., SSE or WebSocket connections). Without this, adding a single new item to the top of an array causes every existing item in the list to re-render, creating an O(n) performance degradation that blocks the main thread.
**Action:** Always extract and memoize list items in components that frequently append or prepend to lists.
## 2026-06-12 - O(N) array search inside object traversal is a major bottleneck
**Learning:** Calling `Object.entries()` inside loops (e.g. for detranslating values based on reverse lookup) is highly inefficient due to array allocations and O(N) searching for reverse key lookups.
**Action:** Use a pre-calculated `REVERSE_DICTIONARY` with a direct lookup utilizing `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` to prevent prototype pollution and achieve O(1) direct property access instead.
## 2026-06-13 - Replaced O(N²) Set allocations and iteration inside jaccardSimilarity with O(1) cached Sets and mathematical union
**Learning:** In the `deduplicateEntries` function, the initial string tokenization (`new Set(text.split(...))`) inside an O(N²) comparison loop via `unique.some()` caused N*M redundant array iterations and garbage collection allocations per loop for both the target and the comparison items. Furthermore, `new Set([...wordsA, ...wordsB])` created unnecessary intermediate array and Set allocations for the Jaccard union.
**Action:** Extract tokenization into a cached array mapping (`uniqueSets`) and reuse them iteratively. Use `union = wordsA.size + wordsB.size - intersection` instead of the spread syntax to bypass object allocations and execute purely mathematically.
## 2026-07-11 - Replaced O(N) Array Searches with O(1) Sets in Validation\n**Learning:** Checking against Enum values using `Object.values(Enum).includes(...)` inside high-frequency validation functions like `validateCanonicalEvent` causes continuous array allocations and O(N) lookups.\n**Action:** Always pre-calculate a `new Set(Object.values(Enum))` outside the function scope and use `.has()` for O(1) validation.
## 2026-09-11 - Replaced Object.entries and Object.keys in deep object traversals with for...in
**Learning:** Using `Object.entries()` or `Object.keys()` inside loops, especially in recursive object processing methods, forces the V8 engine to allocate new arrays and tuple arrays on every recursive iteration over object properties. This adds massive garbage collection overhead and slows down recursive object processing for high-volume payloads.
**Action:** Replace `Object.entries()` and `Object.keys()` loops with a `for...in` loop plus `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` check to significantly improve performance (O(1) allocation overhead).
