## 🎬 LIVE DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"APEX OmniLink uses AI superpowers to deliver enterprise-grade code 4-6x faster. Let me show you how."

### **Demo 1: Test-Driven Development (2 minutes)**
1. Show a feature request
2. Demonstrate: Write test first → See it fail → Implement → See it pass
3. **Key Point**: "We never write code without tests. This prevents 90% of bugs."

### **Demo 2: Systematic Debugging (2 minutes)**
1. Show a bug report
2. Demonstrate: Reproduce → Isolate → Fix → Verify
3. **Key Point**: "We find root causes, not symptoms. This prevents regressions."

### **Demo 3: Code Quality Gates (1 minute)**
1. Show automated checks: TypeScript, ESLint, Tests, Security
2. **Key Point**: "Every commit must pass all quality gates. No exceptions."

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
"This systematic approach means we deliver production-ready code faster, with zero technical debt, and enterprise-grade security."
